The correct SQL query to result in students' names common to both tables having the same id and being sorted alphabetically is:

```sql
SELECT s1.name 
FROM s1 
INNER JOIN s2 ON s1.id = s2.id 
ORDER BY s1.name
```

Explanation:
- The `INNER JOIN` operation will only return rows where there is a match in both tables based on the `id` column.
- The query selects the student names (`s1.name`) where the `id` in table `s1` is equal to the `id` in table `s2`.
- The `ORDER BY s1.name` clause will sort the resulting names alphabetically.

Therefore, the correct option is: 
`select s1.name from s1 INNER JOIN s2 ON s1.id=s2.id ORDER BY s1.name`
