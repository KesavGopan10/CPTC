The report indicates that the main scale of the ratchet studied has a circular scale arrangement with a scale ratio of 25X1mm. This means that for every 25 units on the main scale, the circular scale moves by 1mm. This configuration allows for precise measurements and adjustments to be made using the ratchet device.
