Based on the provided tables and criteria given, the SQL query that will result in students' names common to both tables having the same ID and sorted alphabetically is:

```sql
select s1.name from s1 INNER JOIN s2 ON s1.id=s2.id ORDER BY s1.name
```

This query performs an INNER JOIN between Table s1 and Table s2 on the "id" column where the ids are the same. It selects the student names from Table s1 and then sorts them alphabetically based on the student names.

Therefore, the correct option is the first one: `select s1.name from s1 INNER JOIN s2 ON s1.id=s2.id ORDER BY s1.name`.
